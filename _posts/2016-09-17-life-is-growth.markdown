I lost myself trying to find myself. 

I am just trying to find my place and where I belong. 

`Life` takes you to different places. I've `unexpectedly` lost a loved one and it hurts but I am still here. 

I am still here and I do not plan on leaving until my `time` comes.

We must stay strong when hardship inevitably hits us. We must be like the strong oak that is deepy rooted when a terrible gust of wind hits from every angle.

We must endure. We will endure. And we will grow and get stronger because of it.

**I am grateful for all the good in my life.** 


>This is to all the good people who have supported me
{% highlight ruby %}
For all the good you have given me, 
the love you have shown me, 
I thank you and I 'will' pay you back ten-fold.
{% endhighlight %}

This is my life and this is me. 

Yours Truly,

Emmanuel Hmar
